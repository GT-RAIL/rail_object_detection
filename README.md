[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/GT-RAIL/rail_object_detection.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/GT-RAIL/rail_object_detection)

This repository contains nodes and packages that we use for object detection. All methods of object detection publish objects in the message formats defined in [`rail_object_detection_msgs`](rail_object_detection_msgs/).

## Contents

1. [`rail_object_detection_msgs`](rail_object_detection_msgs/) - the message definitions for packages within this directory.
1. [`rail_object_detector`](rail_object_detector/) - The primary package that we use to perform object detection and recognition from RGB data.
